					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Had a problem where the button wasnt working. The issue was I didnt put the callback inside of the listener.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Worked with Daisy on discord to complete this lab. There was a lot of new terms in the code from the lab that I didnt understand. I think thats okay though, becasue you learn from following along examples. (at least, I do.) 
						The next day, we met up at the I-Lounge to complete the bonus task. It was a little tricky but we were able to figure it out.
