			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Had a small problem were the site wasnt prompting the user to type something,
						I was able to fix it by changing one of the variables (var) to constant (const) and now the site prompts a user input. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Not too bad, I did have to think outside of the box for a bit. Other than that this lab went pretty well. </p>
