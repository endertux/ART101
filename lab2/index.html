			<h1>Hello World!</h1>

			<p>My name is Helwa, 4th year AGPM Major, and my partner is Daisy who is a 2nd year AGPM major. We met last year in our foundational classes. 
			When we met, we shared many of the same interests, and to this day I enjoy talking and hanging out with Daisy, so I'm glad to be taking this class with her.
			</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>HTML & CSS Starter; The challenge was to add "Hello World!" and a description about us and our partner.</p>
						
					<p> I also did the bonus as well to vvv </p>
					<p> Task X: Bonus -> Use Github Desktop to upload the files to GitHub. Go to your yourname.github.io website and take a screenshot of your website on the internet.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem I had was creating a link that takes you back to the homepage. Daisy was able to figure out why it wasn't working, and it was because we were missing a "/" </p>
					
					<p>Before -> href="index.html">back to home </p>
					<p>After -> href="/index.html">back to home </p>

					<p>Another issue we had was the image not loading up when published on github pages. As I am writing this while speaking with Daisy, now there is a 404 error. We were able to fix this by adding the path "art101" to the code.</p>
					<p>Before -> href="/lab2/index.html">Lab 2: HTML & CSS Starter</p>
					<p>After -> href="/ART101/lab2/index.html">Lab 2: HTML & CSS Starter</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>

					<p> I put a pretty good amount of effort into this, especially with the problems we ran into for this lab. 
						As someone with experience in coding, I knew where to start and what to look at.</p>
