					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our problem was the button not working properly, as it was creating a new box inside the box insted of changing the box. 
						This was fixed by moving the button in index.html and moving the div id within div class insted. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Me and Daisy met up at RCC dining hall to work on this, then after my section we finished the lab at the RCC comp lab.
						This lab was for sure one of the harder ones, as we kept running into a problem after another. In the end we were able to fix it together. </p>
